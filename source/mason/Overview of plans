Goal is to run simulations of evolutionary game theory in MASON.
To accomplish this goal we will need:
-a population of players that play games against each other
-players either breed or change player types in response to a win or a loss

-games are most likely restricted to 2 player games
	-require a payoff matrix for each player
	-may be good to have functions such as findNashEquilibrium() etc. to help determine player strategies
	-any abitrary matrix should be able to be added

-players should have some strategy that they follow (?)
	-could translate to being on a certain team

-see bookmarked page in book for more
	-and basically all of chapter 2 and 3
